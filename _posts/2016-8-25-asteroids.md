<dl><blockquote><b>Asteroids</b> is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire.</blockquote></dl>

This particular clone may lack some of the original features, but it does it's best to make up for it with the rainbows.
