<dl><blockquote><a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/paper445.pdf">Perlin noise</a> is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983. In 1997, Perlin was awarded an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for creating the algorithm.</blockquote></dl>

An excerpt from [another paper](http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/%7Estegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf) reads:

<dl><blockquote>Perlin noise is a so-called gradient noise, which means that you set a pseudo-random gradient at regularly spaced points in space, and interpolate a smooth function between those points.</blockquote></dl>

Essentially, it makes pretty images. Here, the noise is used to construct a flow field which guides the motions of colored particles.
Here's the [C++11 implementation](https://github.com/sol-prog/Perlin_Noise) I used.
