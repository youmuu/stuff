<dl><blockquote>Formally, an <a href="http://www.cgjennings.ca/toybox/lsystems/">L-system</a> is a language, which means a set of strings that is made by the application of certain rules. (A string is a sequence of symbolsâ€”the text of this page is a string, for example.)  Informally, L-systems consist of two important pieces: an axiom, and a set of productions. The axiom is the starting point, like a seed. The set of productions are the rules. By applying these rules, any other string in the language can be produced. When the productions are applied to the axiom, they produce more strings which (along with the axiom) are also in the language of that L-system. The rules can then be applied to each of those strings to produce even more strings that are in the language, and so on.</blockquote></dl>
